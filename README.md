# nodecg-react-boilerplate
A boilerplate for NodeCG with React, TypeScript, Babel, and Webpack.

## Setting up

Clone this repository into your NodeCG installation's `bundles` folder. You'll likely want to use a different name, like so:
```sh
git clone git@github.com:ystv/nodecg-react-boilerplate.git my-awesome-bundle
```

If you used a different name, go into `package.json` and change the `name` field to the name of your folder, otherwise NodeCG will refuse to start it.

Run `yarn`.

Run `yarn dev`, and run NodeCG in a separate terminal.
